Apache/AuthPAM version 0.01
===========================

We used to use PAM within CGI programs, written in perl and CGI.pm,
so I freed the ugly script logon process and put the authentication 
job within apache.

It is working with RedHat Linux 7.2, apache-1.3.22-6, perl-5.6.1-26.72.3,
mod_perl-1.26-2 and Authen::PAM-0.13. It is a friendly environment, 
I haven't test it within a hostile one. Let me know if it works 
with something that is not a PC.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

CONFIGURATION

   # /etc/httpd.conf
   <Directory /var/www/https/secured-area/>
     AuthType Basic
     AuthName "your server account"
     PerlAuthHandler Apache::AuthPAM
     PerlSetVar PAMservice check_user
     require valid-user
   </Directory>

   # /etc/pam.d/check_user
   #%PAM-1.0
   auth        required    /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so nodelay
   account     required    /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so

FEATURES

You can select different PAM service name for different directories
or locations in your web server filesystem space.

BUGS

Apache::AuthPAM is running as the same user mod_perl is running
(on RedHat Linux it is apache). It is running without privileges.
I am working a revision using an auxiliar suid process.
